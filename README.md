# Currency Converter

Currency Converter is a simple web application designed to convert income from various currencies to GEL (Georgian Lari) based on a specific date. Additionally, it calculates the total yearly income in GEL. The exchange rates are fetched directly from the National Bank of Georgia's API, ensuring accurate and up-to-date conversions.

This tool was inspired by the need to easily calculate numbers for tax declarations with the correct currency conversions.
